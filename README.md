It is a project given to me in my college to do sentiment analysis on the data

Sentiment Analysis
The project involves sentiment analysis, a natural language processing (NLP) task aimed at determining the sentiment expressed in text data.
The dataset likely consists of textual data along with sentiment labels (Negative, Neutral, Positive), and the goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the sentiment of new text data.
The provided code utilizes a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, a popular choice for text classification tasks due to its simplicity and effectiveness with text data.
Features are extracted from the text data, possibly using techniques like bag-of-words or TF-IDF, and then split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
The classification report provides insights into how well the model performs in classifying sentiments, including precision, recall, and F1-score for each sentiment class.


Precision: This metric measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model. For example, the precision for Positive sentiment is 0.63, indicating that out of all instances predicted as Positive by the model, 63% were actually Positive.
Recall: This metric measures the ability of the model to correctly identify all relevant instances of a class. For example, the recall for Neutral sentiment is 0.51, indicating that the model correctly identified 51% of all Neutral instances.
F1-score: This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. For example, the F1-score for Negative sentiment is 0.69, which considers both precision and recall for Negative sentiment.
Accuracy: This metric measures the overall correctness of the model across all classes. The overall accuracy of the model on the test set is 0.69, indicating that it correctly predicted 69% of the instances.
